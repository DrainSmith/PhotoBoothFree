# PhotoBoothFree
Photobooth software for parties, weddings, and other events.

This runs best on a touch screen Windows tablet such as a Surface, but a regular laptop should work. 

You'll want to edit the StripBackground.png with a graphic that is appropriate for your event and put it in the same folder
as the .exe. You will need to put the click.png in the exe folder as well.

This was created and built on VS2015 with .NET 4.6.1. No other VS version has been tested.

No builds are available at this time. I intend for this to be only available to other developers for now.
